# Workflow: headlands-ring

## Description

Create headlands-ring and interior geometries from field boundaries so the edge area of a field can be measured, visualized, or excluded from analysis. This workflow is intentionally generic: it can be used with soil polygons, point samples, NDVI rasters, yield zones, or any other geometry-driven workflow where the border of the field should be compared with or excluded from the interior.

## When to Use This Workflow

- **Headlands exclusion**: Exclude edge effects from agronomic or remote-sensing analysis
- **Operational analysis**: Quantify headlands acres and the share of a field devoted to turning or overlap zones
- **Polygon comparison**: Split soil zones or management zones into headlands and interior subsets
- **Point flagging**: Mark sample points that fall within the headlands area
- **Raster comparison**: Compare raster summaries between headlands and field interior

## Quick Start

```bash
uv run --with geopandas --with matplotlib --with shapely python << 'EOF'
import geopandas as gpd

from headlands_ring import create_headlands_ring, summarize_headlands

fields = gpd.read_file('my-farm-advisor/field-management/field-boundaries/examples/real_10_fields_iowa.geojson')
field = fields.iloc[[0]].to_crs('EPSG:32615')

ring = create_headlands_ring(field, width_m=9.0)
summary = summarize_headlands(field, ring)

print(summary[['field_area_acres', 'headlands_area_acres', 'headlands_pct']])
EOF
```

## Python API Reference

### `create_headlands_ring(field_gdf, width_m=9.0)`

Create a headlands ring polygon by subtracting an inward buffer from the original field polygon.

### `create_field_interior(field_gdf, width_m=9.0)`

Create the interior polygon that remains after excluding the headlands width.

### `split_headlands_and_interior(field_gdf, width_m=9.0)`

Return both headlands and interior geometries in one call.

### `summarize_headlands(field_gdf, ring_gdf)`

Summarize total field area, headlands area, and headlands share.

### `flag_points_in_headlands(points_gdf, ring_gdf)`

Flag whether input points intersect the headlands geometry.

### `clip_polygons_to_headlands(polygons_gdf, ring_gdf)`

Clip arbitrary polygons to the headlands region.

### `plot_headlands_map(field_gdf, ring_gdf, interior_gdf=None, ...)`

Render a simple map showing field boundary, headlands ring, and optional interior polygon.

## Output Standards

- Preserve CRS and avoid implicit reprojection during geometry operations
- Require projected CRS for width-based calculations in meters
- Use deterministic field metrics for repeatable downstream reporting

## Create a Headlands Ring from a Boundary File

The `create_headlands_ring_from_boundary()` function provides an end-to-end
workflow that starts from an EPSG:4326 field boundary and produces two
GeoPackage files:

1. **field_boundary.gpkg** — the original boundary with `meters_squared`
   and `acres` attributes
2. **headlands_ring.gpkg** — the headlands ring with `meters_squared`
   and `acres` attributes

The function automatically detects the UTM zone from the boundary
centroid, performs all buffer and area calculations in meters, then
reprojects the results back to EPSG:4326.

```bash
uv run --with geopandas python << 'EOF'
import geopandas as gpd
from headlands_ring import create_headlands_ring_from_boundary

boundary = gpd.read_file(
    "my-farm-advisor/field-management/field-boundaries/examples/real_10_fields_iowa.geojson"
)
original, ring = create_headlands_ring_from_boundary(boundary, width_m=21.0)
print(original[['meters_squared', 'acres']])
print(ring[['meters_squared', 'acres']])
EOF
```

A runnable example script is available at
`examples/create_headlands_ring_from_boundary.py`.

## Dependencies

- `geopandas`
- `shapely`
- `matplotlib` for optional plots
